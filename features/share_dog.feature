Feature: User should be able to share their dog by adding an event

As a dog parent
In order to find a sitter on a specific day
I want to post a dog event that others can see

Background: user has been added to the database and logged in
  Given the following users exist:
    | last_name  | first_name | location              | gender | image                      | status  | phone_number  | email                           | description  | availability   | address       | zipcode | city     | country | id |
